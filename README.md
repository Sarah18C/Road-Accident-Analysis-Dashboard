# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard (Power BI)
📊 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of road accident data (Current Year vs. Previous Year) to identify safety trends, high-risk areas, and casualty severity. The project aims to provide actionable insights for transport authorities and urban planners to improve road safety measures.

🚀 Project Objective:

The goal of this project is to:

1)Analyze Casualty Trends: Monitor the year-over-year (YoY) performance of total accidents and casualties.

2)Identify Risk Factors: Evaluate the impact of vehicle types, road types, and light conditions on accident frequency.

3)Geospatial Mapping: Visualize accident hotspots across the UK to prioritize infrastructure improvements.

4)Severity Assessment: Categorize casualties into Fatal, Serious, and Slight to understand the impact of road incidents.


🧮 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total CY Casualties: 195.7K (⬇ 11.9% YoY)

Total CY Accidents: 144.4K (⬇ 11.7% YoY)

CY Fatal Casualties: 2.9K (⬇ 33.3% YoY)

CY Serious Casualties: 27.0K (⬇ 16.2% YoY)

CY Slight Casualties: 165.8K (⬇ 10.6% YoY)


🎯 Business Use Case:

This dashboard helps road safety departments and emergency services to:

1)Identify High-Risk Road Types: Data shows Single Carriageways account for the majority (145K) of casualties.

2)Seasonal Planning: Analyze monthly trends (CY vs PY) to allocate resources during peak accident months.

3)Urban vs. Rural Strategy: Target safety campaigns based on the distribution (61.95% Urban vs. 38.05% Rural).

4)Vehicle-Specific Safety: Address the high volume of casualties associated with Cars (155,804) compared to other vehicle types.

5)Condition Analysis: Understand how Light Conditions (Daylight vs. Dark) and Weather affect road safety.
